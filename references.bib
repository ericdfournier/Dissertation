abstract = {Two factors affecting the centralization of wastewater treatment facilities were investi- gated; the cost of collection and treatment systems and the performance of treatment plants. Based on computer-generated minimum cost designs, wastewater collection networks were found to be characterized by diseconomies of scale of magnitude similar to the reported economies of scale for wastewater treatment works. The combined costs of collection and treatment are U-shaped functions from which the least cost size of collection and treatment systems were found for particular values of population density. Examination of the day-to-day performance of five metropoitan-area waste- water treatment plants revealed that, for time series shorter than one month, the day-to-day variation in effluent quality was random, although the variation in quantity discharged was distinctly non- random. The performances of all five plants on any given day showed little correlation. This suggests that the decentralization of treatment facilities can produce benefits both through the reduction in quantities of waste discharged at a given point and through in-stream averaging of the varying performances of several treatment plants. Since the cost function of collection and treatment com- bined is generally flat in the region of the minimum-cost size, little penalty is invoked to gain the potential benefits of treatment plant decentralization.},

Rising demands for water to supply agriculture, industry and cities are leading to competition over the allocation of limited fresh water resources. This paper examines how water reuse increases the available supply of water and enables human needs to be met with less fresh water. The paper is illustrated with water reuse case studies in agriculture, urban areas, industry and water resource supplementation in Australia and other countries. The links between water reuse and sustainable water management are examined. Water conservation and water reuse produce substantial environmental benefits, arising from reductions in water diversions, and reductions in the impacts of wastewater discharges on environmental water quality. Some examples are presented demonstrating the environmental benefits in quantitative terms. The paper also describes the economic and environmental benefits identified in a number of recent integrated water cycle planning studies in Australia.},

As a multi-disciplined and important element of water resources development and management, water reuse can help to close the loop between water supply and wastewater disposal. Effective water reuse requires integration of water and reclaimed water supply functions. The successful development of this dependable water resource depends upon close examination and synthesis of elements from infrastructure and facilities planning, wastewater treatment plant siting, treatment process reliability, economic and financial analyses, and water utility management. In this paper, fundamental concepts of water reuse are discussed including definitions, historical developments, the role of water recycling in the hydrologic cycle, categories of water reuse, water quality criteria and regulatory requirements, and technological innovations for the safe use of reclaimed water. The paper emphasizes the integration of this alternative water supply into water resources planning, and the emergence of modern water reclamation and reuse practices from wastewater to reclaimed water to repurified water.},

abstract = {Water and energy resources are intrinsically linked, yet they are managed separately--even in the water-scarce American southwest. This study develops a spatially explicit model of water-energy interdependencies in Arizona and assesses the potential for cobeneficial conservation programs. The interdependent benefits of investments in eight conservation strategies are assessed within the context of legislated renewable energy portfolio and energy efficiency standards. The cobenefits of conservation are found to be significant. Water conservation policies have the potential to reduce statewide electricity demand by 0.82-3.1\%, satisfying 4.1-16\% of the state's mandated energy-efficiency standard. Adoption of energy-efficiency measures and renewable generation portfolios can reduce nonagricultural water demand by 1.9-15\%. These conservation cobenefits are typically not included in conservation plans or benefit-cost analyses. Many cobenefits offer negative costs of saved water and energy, indicating that these measures provide water and energy savings at no net cost. Because ranges of costs and savings for water-energy conservation measures are somewhat uncertain, future studies should investigate the cobenefits of individual conservation strategies in detail. Although this study focuses on Arizona, the analysis can be extended elsewhere as renewable portfolio and energy efficiency standards become more common nationally and internationally.},

The success of the field as a research discipline can on the one hand be explained from the beauty of the problems studied and the solutions obtained, and, on the other hand, by the many application domains—computer graphics, geographic information systems (GIS), robotics, and others—in which geometric algorithms play a fundamental role. For many geometric problems the early algorithmic solutions were either slow or difficult to understand and implement. In recent years a number of new algorithmic techniques have been developed that improved and simplified many of the previous approaches. In this textbook we have tried to make these modern algorithmic solutions accessible to a large audience. The book has been written as a textbook for a course in computational geometry, but it can also be used for self-study.},

GIS plays an essential role in wide range of areas and is extensively adopted nowadays. In the simplest terms, GIS is the merging of cartography, statistical analysis, hardware, software and data. GIS is commonly used as a supporting system for making best possible decisions through spatial and non-spatial data relations, visualization and processing. GIS is beneficial and works well when made available to as many people as possible everywhere and anytime at the expense of very less resources in terms of technology and expenditure. Over a few decades efforts are being made to upgrade the conventional GIS applications in order to provide broad spectrum services to the users across the globe. ’Cloud computing’, a term which has become popular in recent years, has been described as “the next natural step in the evolution of on-demand information technology services and products”. Cloud Computing can be applied to solve and overcome the challenges in GIS applications. This paper presents a brief evaluation of Cloud Computing approach to GIS and proposes a multi-tiered architecture for GIS Cloud System.},

abstract = {Data-Driven Documents (D3) is a novel representation-transparent approach to visualization for the web. Rather than hide the underlying scenegraph within a toolkit-specific abstraction, D3 enables direct inspection and manipulation of a native representation: the standard document object model (DOM). With D3, designers selectively bind input data to arbitrary document elements, applying dynamic transforms to both generate and modify content. We show how representational transparency improves expressiveness and better integrates with developer tools than prior approaches, while offering comparable notational efficiency and retaining powerful declarative components. Immediate evaluation of operators further simplifies debugging and allows iterative development. Additionally, we demonstrate how D3 transforms naturally enable animation and interaction with dramatic performance improvements over intermediate representations.},

abstract = {The type of system to be selected for artificial recharge of groundwater and how it should be designed and managed for optimum performance depend entirely on local conditions of soil, hydrogeology, topography, water availability (quality, continuous, or interrupted supply), and climate. Unlike water or wastewater treatment plants, guidelines, standards, and “blueprints” for artificial recharge systems cannot be given. Rather, the responsible planner should have extensive knowledge of the various types of recharge systems that can be used, how they work, the processes, cause and effect relations, what experiences have been obtained elsewhere, and how they should be adapted to local conditions. Once the type system has been selected, a protocol of site investigations should be followed for pre- liminary design. Key factors in the design and management of successful artificial recharge systems are site and system selection, maintenance of adequate infiltration rates, hydraulic continuity between the recharge system and the aquifer (no clay layers in the vadose zone), and groundwater control for effective water recovery and prevention of undue groundwater rises in the recharge area. Another important factor in the selection of the type of recharge system is the pretreatment of the water required before recharge to minimize physical, chemical, or biological clogging of the infiltrating surface (bottom in basins and walls in trenches, shafts, and wells). Since clogging layers are easier to con- trol and remove in surface infiltration systems, proper pretreatment is especially impor- tant for trenches, shafts, and wells. Since trenches and shafts are relatively inexpensive, they can be replaced when their useful life has come to an end. On the other hand, recharge wells, while much more expensive than trenches and shafts, are more amenable to clogging prevention and control by frequent pumping and periodic redevelopment. All these aspects have to be factored in, however, when selecting the type system that gives recharge at minimum cost per unit volume of water put into the aquifer. While presedi- mentation in settling ponds may be adequate pretreatment for surface infiltration systems, recharge with trenches, shafts, and wells may require coagulation and sand filtration to remove suspended solids to acceptable levels. Where sewage effluent is used for ground- water recharge, conventional primary and secondary treatment may be sufficient for sur- face infiltration systems. However, recharge with effluent through wells may require advanced treatment processes including nitrogen and phosphorus removal, sand filtration for removal of suspended solids and parasitic organisms like helminths, Giardia, and Cryptosporidium, disinfection for removal of viruses and bacteria, and reverse osmosis (RO) for removal of organic compounds and other chemicals. If the site investigations indicate no fatal flaws, a small pilot or test project should be installed to gain a better understanding of how the system behaves and how the full-scale system should be designed and managed for best performance. Even then, a phased con- struction should be used for the full-scale system, so that operating experience is obtained and refinements can be made as the rest of the system is designed and constructed. This is especially true for “new” areas where artificial recharge has not yet been practiced. Where local recharge experience already is available, additional systems then are essen- tially expansions of existing systems and the normal protocol of preinvestigations and pilot testing can be reduced. The objective of this chapter is to provide information on the types of recharge systems, how they work, and how they should be designed and managed, so that planners, designers, and managers can make best available decisions.},

abstract = {Reuse of municipal wastewater requires treatment so that the water meets the quality requirements for the intended use. Irrigationn of vegetables consumed raw requires absence of pathogenic organisms. To achieve this, fecal coliform concentrations should be essentially zero and the water should be filtered. This requires intensive treatment. For developing countries, however, where adequate sewage treatment often is lacking, the World Health Organization allows up to 1000 fecal coliform bacteria per 100 ml, which can be obtained by lagooning. Potable reuse requires much more intensive treatment, including lime clarification, denitrification, carbon absorption, reverse osmosis, and disinfection. Where hydrogoelogic conditions permit groundwater recharge with surface infiltration facilities, considerable water quality improvement is obtained by the movement of the wastewater through the soil, vadose zone, and aquifer. The resulting soil-aquifer treatment costs are less that 40\% of the costs of the quivalent in-plant treatment. Soil-aquifer treatment systems also are simple and robust, offer storage of the water to absorb differences between supply and demand, and enhance the aesthetics of potable reuse of wastewater. Hence, they can play an important role in wastewater reuse.},

Water for electricity generation com- prises approximately three percent of consumptive water use in the Colorado River Basin. As water becomes scarcer, it becomes more expensive to generate electricity. The state of energy and water use as they stand will not allow for a water friendly future in the basin. While water for electricity generation comprises three percent of consumptive water use in the basin, water for agriculture constitutes about 80\% of consumptive water use in the basin. Since water rights are ap- propriated toward senior holders first, agriculture will likely continue to receive the majority of water in the basin. If agriculture is the main water consumer, why is there a concern for water use for electricity generation?},

We review existing work that forms the interface between GIS and Location Science and discuss some of the potential research areas involving both GIS and Location Science. 

SCOPE AND PURPOSE
During the past 30 years there have been many developments in spatial data analysis, spatial data storage and retrieval, and mapping. Many of these developments have occurred in the field of Geographical Information Science. Geographical Information Systems software now supports many elementary and advanced spatial analytic approaches including the production of high quality maps. GIS will have a major impact on the field of Location Science in terms of model application and model development. The purpose of this paper is to explore the interface between the field of Location Science and GIS.},

@article{Daughton2004,
abstract = {Our knowledge base regarding the presence and significance of chemicals foreign to the subsurface environment is large and growing—the papers in this volume serving as testament. However, complex questions with few answers surround the unknowns regarding the potential for environmental or human health effects from trace levels of xenobiotics in ground water, especially ground water augmented with treated waste water. Public acceptance for direct or indirect ground water recharge using treated municipal waste water (especially sewage) spans the spectrum from unquestioned embrace to outright rejection. In this paper, I detour around the issues most commonly discussed regarding ground water recharge and instead focus on some of the less-rec- ognized issues—those that emanate from the mysteries created at the many literal and virtual interfaces involved with the sub- surface world. My major objective is to catalyze discussion that advances our understanding of the barriers to public acceptance of waste water reuse with its ultimate culmination in direct reuse for drinking. I pose what could be a key question as to whether much of the public’s frustration or ambivalence in its decision-making process for accepting, or rejecting, water reuse (for vari- ous purposes including personal use) emanates from fundamental inaccuracies, misrepresentation, or oversimplification of what water is and how it functions in the environment—just exactly what the water cycle is. These questions suggest it might behoove us to revisit some very elementary aspects of our science and how we are conveying them to the public.},

abstract = {Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) that use non-dominated sorting and sharing have been criticized mainly for: (1) their O(MN<sup>3</sup>) computational complexity (where M is the number of objectives and N is the population size); (2) their non-elitism approach; and (3) the need to specify a sharing parameter. In this paper, we suggest a non-dominated sorting-based MOEA, called NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II), which alleviates all of the above three difficulties. Specifically, a fast non-dominated sorting approach with O(MN<sup>2</sup>) computational complexity is presented. Also, a selection operator is presented that creates a mating pool by combining the parent and offspring populations and selecting the best N solutions (with respect to fitness and spread). Simulation results on difficult test problems show that NSGA-II is able, for most problems, to find a much better spread of solutions and better convergence near the true Pareto-optimal front compared to the Pareto-archived evolution strategy and the strength-Pareto evolutionary algorithm - two other elitist MOEAs that pay special attention to creating a diverse Pareto-optimal front. Moreover, we modify the definition of dominance in order to solve constrained multi-objective problems efficiently. Simulation results of the constrained NSGA-II on a number of test problems, including a five-objective, seven-constraint nonlinear problem, are compared with another constrained multi-objective optimizer, and the much better performance of NSGA-II is observed},

Fifteen works have been studied, representing a range of size and type of treatment works. Five management regimes for centralising sludge treatment and disposal were analyzed in the context of LCA to provide guidance on choosing the best practicable environmental option (BPEO). Consideration of Global warming potential indicates that the four proposed management regimes with centralisation of sludge for treatment and disposal, as adopted by Thames Water Utilities Ltd., is an environmental improvement upon the current practice. One of these options, that of complete centralisation and composting of sludge prior to disposal, exerts the least environmental impact with respect to Global warming potential. This suggests that the adoption of composting at Crawley is environmentally preferable to increasing the digestion facility at this works.},

For the first time, a wide range of hypothesized factors, both of socio-demographic and psychographic nature, are included simultaneously. The key results, based on a survey study of about 3000 respondents are that: (1) drivers of the stated likelihood of using desalinated water differ somewhat from drivers of the stated likelihood of using recycled water; (2) positive perceptions of, and knowledge about, the respective water source are key drivers for the stated likelihood of usage; and (3) awareness of water scarcity, as well as prior experience with using water from alternative sources, increases the stated likelihood of use. Practical recommendations for public policy makers, such as key messages to be communicated to the public, are derived.},

abstract = {Many countries' water resources are limited in both quantity and quality. While engineering solutions can now safely produce recycled and desalinated water from non-potable sources at a relatively low cost, the general public is sceptical about adopting these alternative water sources. Social scientists, policy makers and technical experts need to better understand what is causing this lack of acceptance by the general population and how acceptance levels for recycled and desalinated water can be increased. This study is the first to conduct a comparative analysis of knowledge, perceptions, and acceptability, and determine segments of residents who are more open-minded than the general population toward the use of recycled and desalinated water. The Australian population once perceived desalinated water as environmentally unfriendly, and recycled water as a public health hazard. The general level of knowledge about these two concepts as potential water sources has historically been low. After nearly five years of serious drought, accompanied by severe water restrictions across most of the country, and subsequent media attention on solutions to water scarcity, Australians now show more acceptance of desalinated water for close-to-body uses, and less resistance to recycled water for garden watering and cleaning uses. The types of people likely to be strong accepters of the two alternative water sources are distinctly different groups, and can be reached through different media mixes. This finding has significant implications for policy makers and water practitioners.},

abstract = {Water availability represents a growing concern for meeting future power generation needs. In the United States, projected population growth rates, energy consumption patterns, and demand from competing water use sectors will increase pressure on power generators to reduce water use. Water availability and use also exhibit strong regional variations, complicating the nature of public policy and technological response. The US Department of Energy’s (DOE) National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) is engaged in a research and development (R\&D) program to reduce freshwater withdrawal (total quantity of water utilized) and consumption (portion of withdrawal not returned to the source) from existing and future thermoelectric power generating facilities. The Innovations for Existing Plants (IEP) Program is currently developing technologies in 5 categories of water management projects to reduce water use while minimizing the impacts of plant operations on water quality. This paper outlines the freshwater withdrawal and consumption rates for various thermoelectric power generating types and then estimates the potential benefits of IEP program technologies at both the national and regional levels in the year 2030. NETL is working to protect and conserve water resources while leveraging domestic fossil fuel resources, such as coal, to increase national energy security.},

abstract = {The paper presents a life-cycle energy analysis LCEA to quantify energy expenditures in the fabrication, use, and end-of-life stages of the pipes of a water distribution system. The methodology incorporates the capabilities of environmental input-output life-cycle analysis to quantify the energy required to fabricate pipes. The EPANET2 hydraulic model is applied in conjunction with a pipe-aging model to calculate the theoretical energy recovery in the use stage. An exponential pipe-break model is applied to quantify the energy required to repair pipe breaks during the use stage of a system. Simple formulations are developed to estimate the energy required to dispose of and recycle pipes once their service period has expired. The LCEA methodology is then applied to the New York City NYC water supply tunnels example to quantify energy expenditures in four planning scenarios with 10-, 20-, 50-, and 100-year pipe replace- ment frequencies. The results of the NYC example highlight the tension between the energy costs incurred in the fabrication and end-of-life stages of a system and those incurred in the use stage. A pipe-replacement period roughly equal to 50 years yielded the lowest overall energy expenditure in the three life stages. A sensitivity analysis was carried out to assess the influence of uncertain system parameters on energy expenditure estimates.},

abstract = {Bioenergy expansion can signifi cantly impact water resources in the region in which it occurs. Investment, policy, and resource management decisions related to bioenergy should therefore take this criti- cal consideration into account. Water resource impacts can defy easy quantifi cation because water consump- tion varies spatially and temporally, different water sources are not necessarily commensurable, and impact depends on the state of the resource base that is drawn upon. This perspective offers an assessment frame- work that operators and policy-makers can use in evaluating projects to avoid or mitigate detrimental effects. We adapt water footprint (WF) and life cycle assessment (LCA) techniques to the bioenergy context, describing comprehensive life cycle inventory (LCI) approaches that account for blue and green water use as well as for pol- lution effects, varying sources, coproduct allocation, and spatial heterogeneity. Impact assessment requires that characterization (weighting) factors be derived so that consumption values can be summed and compared across resources and locations. We recommend that characterization draw on metrics of water stress, accounting for environmental fl ow requirements, climatic variability, and non-linearity of water stress effects. Finally, we describe some location-specifi c impacts of concern that may not be revealed through common analytical approaches and may warrant closer consideration.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to generate information on the environmental profile of the life cycle of water, including treatment, distribution and collection and disposal (including recycling), in an urban context. As a case study the eThekwini Municipality (with its main city Durban) in South Africa was used. Another aim of the study was to compare the environmen- tal consequences for the provision of normal, virgin potable water vs. recycled water to industry in Durban. Therefore, a series of environmental life cycle assessments (LCAs) were performed and environmental scores were calculated for the processes involved in the treatment, recycling and disposal of water and wastewater. In order to enable the addition of these scores the same approach was adopted and the same methodology was used and a final environmental profile was produced. This study shows that a system approach as well as a process approach is needed for the integral assessment of the environmental performance in the provision of water and wastewater services. From the LCAs of individual processes involved in the provision of water and wastewater in the eThekwini Municipality, it emerged that the process with the high- est contribution is the activated sludge process - used in the treatment of wastewater. However, when considering the entire system and including the losses in the distribution network for potable water, the process with the highest contribution became the distribution itself. An improvement analysis was performed and is presented. It takes into account a series of possible interventions and their consequences. Most notably, one conclusion of this study is that recycling as currently undertaken in Durban, has positive environmental impacts. Keywords: urban water systems, recycling a},

abstract = {This paper deals with the optimum design of a distributed wastewater network where multicomponent streams are considered that are to be processed by units for reducing the concentration of several contaminants. The proposed model gives rise to a nonconvex nonlinear problem which often exhibits local minima and causes convergence difficulties. A search procedure is proposed in this paper that is based on the successive solution of a relaxed linear model and the original nonconvex nonlinear problem. Several examples are presented to illustrate that the proposed method often yields global or near global optimum solutions. The model is also extended for selecting different treatment technologies and for handling membrane separation modules.},

abstract = {Geographic information systems (GIS) use is presented in the problem of sitting areas for construction of natural systems such as stabilization ponds (SPs) for domestic wastewater treatment. For this purpose, several variables, such as topography, land use, type of geological formation, distance to major rivers or lakes, distance to existing cities and villages, existence of environmentally protected areas, mean minimum monthly temperatures and required wastewater effluent characteristics were analyzed with the GIS, in order to accept or reject a particular area within a region. The method is applied in the region of Thrace (Northeast Greece) at the municipal level. The required area for SP systems was calculated in each of the 36 municipalities of Thrace (including two islands, Thassos and Samothraki) as a function of the population of each municipality, temperature and local wastewater effluent discharge criteria. Based on the GIS analysis, suitable locations were identified in each municipality first, and then the total required surface area of these systems was compared to the available surface area of each municipality, in order to decide whether SP systems could be a viable solution to the wastewater management problem in the particular region. In that way the present methodology offers a fast and simple method to check the suitability of new areas for construction of such systems.},

abstract = {Flood spreading is an inexpensive method for flood miti- gation and artificial recharge of aquifers that results in a large budget return for relatively small investment. It is necessary to study some regional characteristics in order to determine the appropriate areas for artificial groundwater recharge by flood spreading in Meimeh Basin, Isfahan Province, Iran. Necessary regional characteristics to be studied are: slope, infiltration rate, sediment thickness, transmissivity, and water quality. In this research to identify suitable areas for artificial recharge several thematic layers were pre- pared, assigning each layer to one of the mentioned characteristics. The thematic layers were classified to several classes based on the existing criteria. All of the classes of the thematic layers were integrated and analyzed using a decision support system (DSS) in a geographical information system (GIS) environ- ment. Finally suitability of the inte- grated classes for artificial recharge was identified in which the following classes were separated: (i) Very suitable, (ii) suitable, (iii) moderate suitability, and (iv) unsuitable. The validity of the generated model was verified by applying the model to a number of successful floodwater spreading stations throughout Iran. The verified model showed satisfactory results for all of the stations. The results for Meimeh Basin showed that about 70\% of the Quaternary sediments in the studied area are suitable and moderately suitable for artificial recharge by flood spreading.},

abstract = {A genetic algorithm (GA) is a procedure that mimics processes occurring in Darwinian evolution to solve computational problems. A GA introduces variation through "mutation" and "recombination" in a "population" of possible solutions to a problem, encoded as strings of characters in "genomes," and allows this population to evolve, using selection procedures that favor the gradual enrichment of the gene pool with the genomes of the "fitter" individuals. GAs are particularly suitable for optimization problems in which an effective system design or set of parameter values is sought.In nature, genetic regulatory networks (GRNs) form the basic control layer in the regulation of gene expression levels. GRNs are composed of regulatory interactions between genes and their gene products, and are, inter alia, at the basis of the development of single fertilized cells into fully grown organisms. This paper describes how GAs may be applied to find functional regulatory schemes and parameter values for models that capture the fundamental GRN characteristics. The central ideas behind evolutionary computation and GRN modeling, and the considerations in GA design and use are discussed, and illustrated with an extended example. In this example, a GRN-like controller is sought for a developmental system based on Lewis Wolpert's French flag model for positional specification, in which cells in a growing embryo secrete and detect morphogens to attain a specific spatial pattern of cellular differentiation.},

abstract = {Wastewater reuse is being widely promulgated to help address the global freshwater resource crisis. It can assist in reducing extraction of freshwater from the environment, and reuse of wastewater lessens the need for environmental discharge, which is clearly beneficial to receiving waters. But the practice itself also has the potential to be detrimental to natural and human environments: soil structure can become degraded, aquifers may be polluted, and human health may be threatened. The challenge facing natural resource managers is to identify the potential benefits and risks, and to achieve an appropriate balance. This paper describes environmental benefits and threats concomitant with the reuse of wastewater. We frequently draw upon examples from China and Australia-two countries that face particularly daunting water resource challenges-but the principles can be.extended far beyond these geographical bounds and are applicable to many parts of the world.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to determine the comparative environmental impacts of coupled seawater desalination and water reclamation using a novel hybrid system that consist of an osmotically driven membrane process and established membrane desalina- tion technologies. A comparative life cycle assessment methodology was used to differ- entiate between a novel hybrid process consisting of forward osmosis (FO) operated in osmotic dilution (ODN) mode and seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO), and two other processes: a stand alone conventional SWRO desalination system, and a combined SWRO and dual barrier impaired water purification system consisting of nanofiltration followed by reverse osmosis. Each process was evaluated using ten baseline impact categories. It was demonstrated that from a life cycle perspective two hurdles exist to further devel- opment of the ODN-SWRO process: module design of FO membranes and cleaning inten- sity of the FO membranes. System optimization analysis revealed that doubling FO membrane packing density, tripling FO membrane permeability, and optimizing system operation, all of which are technically feasible at the time of this publication, could reduce the environmental impact of the hybrid ODN-SWRO process compared to SWRO by more than 25\%; yet, novel hybrid nanofiltration-RO treatment of seawater and wastewater can achieve almost similar levels of environmental impact.},

abstract = {Usually the methodologies used to analyse the feasibility of water reuse projects are focused on the internal costs. The aim of this paper is to show a methodology to assess the feasibility of a water reuse project taking into account not just the internal impact, but also the external impact (environmental and social, for example) and the opportunity cost derived from the project. Internal benefit is obtained from the difference between internal income and internal costs. Internal income is obtained by multiplying the selling price of reclaimed water and the volume obtained. Internal costs are made up of the sum of investment costs, operating costs, financial costs and taxes. While some of these factors identified can be calculated directly in terms of money, biophysical and social aspects demand the definition of units of measurement. In order to homogenize results, an annual reference is proposed. A monetary value can be obtained from the calculation of each impact. However, there are a series of externalities for which no explicit market exists. In these cases economic valuation methods are used, based on hypothetical scenarios or patterns observed in related markets.},

The Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) estimated, that the energy demand for the water and wastewater industry would be approximately 75 billion kilowatt hours per year, or about 3 percent of the electricity consumed in the United States. The Consortium for Energy Efficiency now estimates the annual energy usage at approximately 100 billion kWh per year. This book explores the energy conservation measures (ECMs) and energy management strategies being developed at many wastewater facilities across the United States. Improving the energy efficiency of America's drinking water and wastewater systems by 10 percent could save over 10 billion kWh each year, representing a cost savings of approximately \$750 million annually.},

abstract = {Located approximately 100km west of Brisbane, Toowoomba is home to approximately 95,000 people. Surface water from dams is the main source of water for the city. In 2006 the residents of Toowoomba were invited to vote in a referendum (plebiscite) concerning whether or not an indirect potable wastewater reuse scheme should be constructed to supply additional water to the area. At that stage dam levels in Toowoomba were at approximately twenty percent of capacity. Toowoomba residents, after intense campaigning on both sides of the referendum debate, voted against the proposal. In July 2008 dam levels dropped to eleven percent. Stage 5 water restrictions have been in place since September 2006, subsequently mains water must not be used for any outdoor uses. This paper describes in detail how public opposition in the case of Toowoomba's referendum, defeated the proposal for a water augmentation solution. Reasons for the failure are analysed. In so doing, the paper provides valuable insights with respect to public participation in indirect potable reuse proposals, and discusses factors including politics, vested interest and information manipulation. This paper is significant because of the lack of detailed information published about failed water infrastructure projects.},

@article{Hurlimann2009,
abstract = {Water is a scarce resource in many parts of the developed world. Two solutions are possible to address water scarcity: conservation of existing resources, or the further production of water from new sources e.g. through recycling of wastewater or desalination of seawater. However, the main hurdle to implementation of many of these solutions is often viewed as a lack of public willingness to adopt these alternative water behaviours. Research in this area is therefore crucial. Yet, and possibly due to the interdisciplinary nature of such research, there is currently no comprehensive overview of what has been done before. This study fills this gap by (1) choosing a general consumer behaviour perspective as a starting point, (2) developing a conceptual model of research required in the area of water-related public acceptance studies, (3) identifying eight key water-related behaviours which require future research attention, and (4) reviewing which areas of the conceptual model have been investigated in the past by conducting an extensive literature review of water-related social science research. The review established that the majority of work which has been conducted is located at the cross-roads of personal characteristics and behavioural intentions. Significant gaps exist in relation to researching the adoption of a wide range of demand-side water behaviours. This indicates a dominance of supply-side solutions in social-research exploration. The review identifies a number of research needs including: the exploration of actual adoption of water-related behaviours (rather than behavioural intentions); and to widen the scope of water behaviour enquiry to include more demand-side solutions. Given the increasing scarcity of water in many areas of the world, addressing these identified gaps will be of significant importance. Thus our model informs the social-research agenda for water policy.},

In this work different alternatives of tertiary treatment (conventional treatments and one treatment including ultrafiltration) were evaluated using two pilot plants (2 m3 /h of capacity) located in the wastewater treatment plant of Quart-Benager in Valencia. Settling (with and without chemicals addition), conventional sand filtration, UV disinfection and ultrafiltration were the processes included in the different alternatives. Results showed that the most efficient conventional alternative consisting in settling + filtration + UV radiation and the treatment including ultrafiltration eliminated almost the 100\% of the total coliforms. However COD removal was very much higher in the alternative including ultrafiltration (60\%) in comparison with the other process combinations.},

The decision-making process, involving policy priorities, trade-offs, and uncertainties, can be aided by Multiple Criteria Decision making (MCDM) methods. This paper presents a framework for integrating geographical information systems (GIs) and MCDM methods. In this framework the MCDM methods are classified and matched with choice heuristics used by the decision-makers in the presence of competing alternatives and multiple evaluation criteria. Two strategies for integrating GIs with MCDM are proposed. The first strategy suggests linking GIS and MCDM techniques using a file exchange mechanism. The second strategy suggests integrating CIS and MCDM functions using a common database. The paper presents the implementation of the first strategy using PC-ARCnNFO, a file exchange module, and four different MCDM computer programs.},

abstract = {This analysis presents the results of a life cycle assessment (LCA) carried out on six alternative options for the recycling of water at a Danish industrial laundry for workwear. The study focuses on the handling and disposal of the wet residues generated when wastewater is treated for recycling, and in accounting for long-term potential toxicity impacts. The analysed options are a combination of two water-upgrading technologies: biofilter and ultrafiltration, and three residue disposal alternatives: biogas followed by incineration of sludge at local wastewater treatment plant, thermal vitrifica- tion treatment for production of vitrified sand, and minerali- zation in a sludge bed. It is concluded from the results that with the current Danish environmental policy priorities, the environmental impacts of highest priority are the toxicity effects derived from the presence of heavy metals in the resi- dues. Heavy metals originate from the dirt in the workwear that is washed in the laundry. It is further concluded that the studied water treatment technologies satisfy both the need of clean water for recycling and simultaneously help controlling a safe disposal of pollutants by concentration of the residues. The results of the study also confirm the potential of LCA as a decision-support tool for assisting water recycling initiatives and for residue handling management. The handling of resi- dues has been identified as a stage of the water recycling strat- egy that bears important environmental impacts. This holis- tic perspective provided by LCA can be used as input for the definition of environmental management strategies at an industrial laundry, and the prioritization of investments to the environmental profile of laundry processes. In this case- study, the results of the LCA are made operational by, for example, selecting the water treatment technology which is associated wih a safe disposal of the wet residue. It is impor- tant to bear in mind that such prioritization depends on national boundary conditions. In the case study analysed, the boundary conditions steer the weighing of the environmental impacts, following the current Danish environmental policy priorities.},

Different treatment applications in terms of behaviour of key microbial and chemical contaminants are assessed. Engineered as well as natural treatment trains are investigated to provide guidance for sustainable MAR schemes using alternative sources such as effluent and stormwater. The technologies considered are also well suited to the needs of developing countries, which have a growing need of supplementation of freshwater resources. A broad range of international full-scale case studies enables insights into long-term system behaviour, operational aspects, and fate of a comprehensive number of compounds and contaminants, especially organic micropollutants and bulk organics.

To be sustainable, a water reuse project must serve its long-term functional roles without shifting environmental burdens to future generations or producing adverse socio-economic effects. In this paper, we review sustainability assessment methods to aid decision makers in comparing alternative systems, improving environmental performance, and tracking progress toward sustainability. We discuss concerns regarding long-term environmental effects of water reuse systems, including energy demands, impacts on irrigated land, and accumulation and health effects of trace contaminants. We also suggest socio-economic considerations that are key to maintaining long-term benefits of water reuse systems.},

abstract = {Estimates of water use in the United States indicate that about 410 billion gallons per day (Bgal/d) were withdrawn in 2005 for all categories summarized in this report. This total is slightly less than the estimate for 2000, and about 5 percent less than total withdrawals in the peak year of 1980. Fresh- water withdrawals in 2005 were 349 Bgal/d, or 85 percent of the total freshwater and saline-water withdrawals. Fresh groundwater withdrawals of 79.6 Bgal/day in 2005 were about 5 percent less than in 2000, and fresh surface-water withdrawals of 270 Bgal/day were about the same as in 2000. Withdrawals for thermoelectric-power generation and irriga- tion, the two largest uses of water, have stabilized or decreased since 1980. Withdrawals for public-supply and domestic uses have increased steadily since estimates began. Thermoelectric-power generation water withdrawals were an estimated 201 Bgal/d in 2005, about 3 percent more than in 2000. In 2005, thermoelectric freshwater withdrawals accounted for 41 percent of all freshwater withdrawals. Nearly all of the water withdrawn for thermoelectric power was surface water used for once-through cooling at power plants. Twenty- nine percent of thermoelectric-power withdrawals were saline water from oceans and brackish coastal water bodies. Withdrawals for irrigation in 2005 were 128 Bgal/d, about 8 percent less than in 2000 and approximately equal to estimates of irrigation water use in 1970. In 2005, irriga- tion withdrawals accounted for 37 percent of all freshwater withdrawals and 62 percent of all freshwater withdrawals excluding thermoelectric withdrawals. Irrigated acreage increased from 25 million acres in 1950 to 58 million acres in 1980, then remained fairly constant before increasing in 2000 and 2005 to more than 60 million acres. The number of acres irrigated using sprinkler and microirrigation systems has continued to increase and in 2005 accounted for 56 percent of the total irrigated acreage. Water withdrawals for public supply were 44.2 Bgal/d in 2005, which is 2 percent more than in 2000, although the population increased by more than 5 percent during that time. Public supply accounted for 13 percent of all freshwater withdrawals in 2005 and 21 percent of all freshwater with- drawals excluding thermoelectric withdrawals. The percentage of the U.S. population obtaining drinking water from public suppliers has increased steadily from 62 percent in 1950 to 86 percent in 2005. Most of the population providing their own household water obtained their supplies from ground- water sources. Self-supplied industrial water withdrawals continued to decline in 2005, as they have since their peak in 1970. Self- supplied industrial withdrawals were an estimated 18.2 Bgal/d in 2005, a 30-percent decrease from 1985. An estimated 4.02 Bgal/d were withdrawn for mining in 2005, which is 11 percent less than in 2000, and 18 percent less than in 1990. Withdrawals for mining were only 58 percent freshwater. Livestock water use was estimated to be 2.14 Bgal/d in 2005, which is the smallest estimate since 1975, possibly due to the use of standardized coefficients for estimation of animal water needs. Water use for aquaculture was an estimated 8.78 Bgal/d in 2005, nearly four times the amount estimated in 1985. Part of this increase is due to the inclusion of more facilities in the estimates in 2005, and the use of standardized coefficients for estimating aquaculture use from other data. Fresh surface water was the source for a majority of the public-supply, irrigation, aquaculture, thermoelectric, and industrial withdrawals. Nearly 30 percent of all fresh surface-water withdrawals in 2005 occurred in five States. In California, Idaho, and Colorado, most of the fresh sur- face-water withdrawals were for irrigation. In Texas and Illinois, most of the fresh surface-water withdrawals were for thermoelectric power generation. About 67 percent of fresh groundwater withdrawals in 2005 were for irrigation, and 18 percent were for public supply. More than half of fresh groundwater withdrawals in the United States in 2005 occurred in six States. In California, Texas, Nebraska, Arkansas, and Idaho, most of the fresh groundwater withdrawals were for irrigation. In Florida, 52 percent of all fresh groundwater withdrawals were for public supply, and 34 percent were for irrigation.},

This research examined approaches to reducing drought vulnerability, focusing on five water agencies on California’s north and central coast that rely on local and regional sources of water. Curtailing water use is the principal response to drought. In contrast, this project highlights an important but underutilized proactive adaptation to improve water supply security during drought: the development of locally based groundwater drought reserves. While this approach represents an obvious solution in principle, it is uncommon to find it in practice, and this research provides insight into (1) motivating factors, (2) legal barriers and opportunities, (3) tools, and (4) policy options to support increased drought resilience and the development of drought reserves.},

abstract = {In Phoenix, Arizona and other metropolitan areas, water governance challenges include variable climate conditions, growing demands, and continued groundwater overdraft. Based on an actor-oriented examination of who does what with water and why, along with how people interact with hydro-ecological systems and man-made infrastructure, we present a sustainability appraisal of water governance for the Phoenix region. Broadly applicable to other areas, our systems approach to sustainable water governance overcomes prevailing limitations to research and management by: employing a comprehensive and integrative perspective on water systems; highlighting the activities, intentions, and rules that govern various actors, along with the values and goals driving decisions; and, establishing a holistic set of principles for social-ecological system integrity and interconnectivity, resource efficiency and maintenance, livelihood sufficiency and opportunity, civility and democratic governance, intra- and inter-generational equity, and finally, precaution and adaptive capacity. This study also contributes to reforming and innovating governance regimes by illuminating how these principles are being met, or not, in the study area. What is most needed in metropolitan Phoenix is enhanced attention to ecosystem functions and resource maintenance as well as social equity and public engagement in water governance. Overall, key recommendations entail: addressing interconnections across hydrologic units and sub-systems (e.g., land and water), increasing decentralized initiatives for multiple purposes (e.g., ecological and societal benefits of green infrastructure), incorporating justice goals into decisions (e.g., fair allocations and involvement), and building capacity through collaborations and social learning with diverse interests (e.g., scientists, policymakers, and the broader public).},

abstract = {Municipal water recycling processes are potential human and environmental exposure routes for low concentrations of persistent antibiotics. While the implications of such exposure scenarios are unknown, concerns have been raised regarding the possibility that continuous discharge of antibiotics to the environment may facilitate the development or proliferation of resistant strains of bacteria. As potable and non-potable water recycling schemes are continuously developed, it is imperative to improve our understanding of the fate of antibiotics during conventional and advanced wastewater treatment processes leading to high-quality water reclamation. This review collates existing knowledge with the aim of providing new insight to the influence of a wide range of treatment processes to the ultimate fate of antibiotics during conventional and advanced wastewater treatment. Although conventional biological wastewater treatment processes are effective for the removal of some antibiotics, many have been reported to occur at 10-1000 ng L(-1) concentrations in secondary treated effluents. These include beta-lactams, sulfonamides, trimethoprim, macrolides, fluoroquinolones, and tetracyclines. Tertiary and advanced treatment processes may be required to fully manage environmental and human exposure to these contaminants in water recycling schemes. The effectiveness of a range of processes including tertiary media filtration, ozonation, chlorination, UV irradiation, activated carbon adsorption, and NF/RO filtration has been reviewed and, where possible, semi-quantitative estimations of antibiotics removals have been provided.},

Potential expansion of facilities in Western Suffolk County, Long Island, New York is considered. A mixed integer programming approach is utilized. Each system element cost, taken as a function of wastewater flow, is represented by a linear variable cost plus a fixed cost. The objective is to minimize total cost while ensuring that all wastewater flow generated is treated. Political and administrative feasibility and the location of effluent discharge constrain the model. The Long Island problem is too large to be solved with a standard formulation of wastewater network as a mixed integer programming problem. To improve computational efficiency, additional constraints are introduced on the minimum flow in each pipe and on the number of pipes leaving each node. Network configurations obtained for Western Suffolk County show that limiting development plans to 201 regions is not cost effective. Regional solutions indicate a general tradeoff between lower costs for coastal discharge and increased groundwater recharge.},

Life cycle assessment (LCA) was performed to evaluate the environmental impacts of principal contributors in a TWTNS. The LCA results were integrated into the objective function of the model. The mass balances were formulated from the superstructure model, and the constraints were formulated to reflect real wastewater treatment situations in industrial plants. A case study validated the model and demonstrated the effect of the objective function on the configuration and environmental performance of a TWTNS.

In this article we discuss a methodology tailored to strategic planning needs which retains a high degree of model segmentation in order toenhancemodeling ofalarge, complex system. This is illustrated by a case study of Sydney Water, which is Australia’s largest water service provider. A prospective LCA was carried out to examine the potential environmental impacts of Sydney Water’s total operations in the year 2021. To our knowledge this is the first study to create an LCA model of an integrated water and wastewater system with this degree of complexity. A “base case” system model was constructed to represent current operating assets as augmented and upgraded to 2021. The base case results provided a basis for the comparison of alternative future scenariosandfor conclusions tobedrawnregarding potential environmental improvements. The scenarios can be roughly classified in two catego- ries: (1) options which improve the environmental performance across all impact categories and (2) options which improve one indicator and worsen others. Overall environmental improvements are achieved in all categories by the scenarios examining increaseddemandmanagement, energy efficiency, energy generation, and additional energy recovery from biosolids. The scenarios which examined desalination of seawater and the upgrades of major coastal sewage treatment plants to secondary and tertiary treatment produced an improvement in one environmental indicator but deteriorations in all the other impact categories, indicating the environmental tradeoffs within the system. The desalination scenario produced a significant increase in greenhouse gas emissions due to coal- fired electricity generation for a small increase in water supply. Assessment of a greenfield scenario incorporating water demand management, on-site treatment, local irrigation, and centralized biosolids treatment indicates significant environmental improvements are possible relative to the assessment ofaconventional system of corresponding scale.},

abstract = {Infrastructure for the provision of drinking water and the treatment of wastewater and stormwater, is essential for an urban society. In this project methods are developed which measure and assess the sustainability of urban water systems. A first set of environmental sustainability indicators (ESIs) was constructed, covering technical and environmental aspects, with a division within traditional water resources and process boundaries. The ESIs were applied in case studies in G\"{o}teborg, Sweden and King William’s Town, South Africa. The ESIs demonstrated that the urban water system in G\"{o}teborg has moved towards environmental sustainability, but that recycling of nutrients to agriculture remains a major concern. The situation in King’s Williams Town was quite different due to an increasing population and an increasing pressure on water resources. One of the findings from the case studies was that a more rational procedure for the selection of ESIs is required. Further, consideration of system boundary extensions is essential for the provision of a relevant assessment. At this point an iterative ESI selection procedure based on life cycle assessment (LCA) was developed. The strength of LCA was demonstrated in two studies comparing technical options. First, LCA was used to compare projected wastewater systems with increased recycling of plant nutrients. Urine separation in combination with existing large-scale treatment was demonstrated to be a promising option that improves the opportunities for recycling of nutrients. Thereby water emissions are lowered, as well as energy use since the production of mineral fertilisers can be decreased. The benefits of separation systems were first revealed when the system boundaries were expanded to include fertiliser production. LCA combined with a cost analysis provided an assessment of four sewage sludge options. It was shown that incineration and agricultural use have respectively economic and environmental restrictions. The development of relatively low cost phosphorus recovery technologies has the potential to reconcile the environmental and economic aspects of sustainability. Finally, the iterative procedure for ESI selection was applied and evaluated in a cooperative study with Stockholm Water to ensure indicator user interaction. A number of assessment tools (including LCA) were used as an input to rank technical options for handling sludge in a multi criteria analysis and led to the selection of indicators that reflect the economic, environmental and social aspects of sustainability for wastewater and sludge handling systems.},

The main objective of this research is the identification of suitable GAR sites scattered in the Shahrekord plain, Chahar- mahal-va-Bakhtiari province of Iran, using Boolean and Fuzzy logic. Data affecting GAR including ground surface slope, soil infiltration rate, vadoze zone thickness, electrical conductivity of the surface water, land-use, and stream network were collected. After provision of digital maps, they were classified, weighted, and integrated through Boolean and Fuzzy operators. The result revealed almost 4.25\% of the whole plain area is appropriate for GAR based on Boolean. Also, 4.79 and 17.94\% of the plain area are suitable and rather favorable, respectively, based on Fuzzy. Finally, 34 locations were introduced with priorities A, B, and AB as being potentially suitable for GAR. The relationship between geomorphology and suitable areas for GAR based on Boolean and Fuzzy method indicated that the majority of these areas were located on colluvial fans units.},

The monograph focuses on two perspectives of GIS-based land-use suitability analysis: the techno-positivist perspective and the socio-political, public participation perspectives. It is organized into six chapters. After an introductory setting chapter, which defines the scope of land-use suitability analysis, an overview of relevant \{GIS\} technology is provided in Chapter 2. Chapter 3 offers an historical account of the development of GIS. It also discusses the development of \{GIS\} in the context of evolving perspectives of planning. Chapter 4 gives an overview of the methods for GIS-based land-use suitability modeling. The overview provides a background against which selected case studies are discussed in Chapter 5. The concluding chapter summarized the main points of the monographs and discusses problems and prospects for GIS-based land-use suitability analysis.},

abstract = {Artificial groundwater recharge is of increasing importance as an essential component of water-management programs. The fluctuation of the water table in response to recharge depends on the size and shape of the recharging area, on the duration and the type of variation of the recharge rate, and on the hydraulic and geometric parameters of the underlying aquifer. Numerial solutions describing the formation of groundwater mounds are obtained by applying the Douglas-Jones predictor-corrector method to the second-order, nonlinear, partial-differential equation characterizing the unsteady flow in an unconfined aquifer beneath a circular uniformly recharging area. An advantage of using the method is that the predictor-corrector equations result in a tridiagonal set of simultaneous equations which can be solved rapidly in a digital computer. Furthermore, the method is computationally stable.},

abstract = {Ensuring adequate water supplies in urban Australia is a problem of consider- able concern to State and federal governments. A variety of technical solutions are available, including water recycling. While there has been policy support for water recycling, public perceptions are seen by industry stakeholders as a significant impediment to the implementation of recycled water schemes. This article reports baseline data on attitudes to water recycling and its uses in a representative sample of Australians from major urban areas. Sociological frameworks for interpreting the results focus on understanding how people assess the risks associated with recycled water. Three perspectives are out- lined, and their consistency with the survey results is analysed. The episte- mologically realist view, often the fallback of water professionals and policy makers, is shown to have limited applicability. An interpretation focused on the cultural meanings associated with different forms and uses of water is found to be consistent with many aspects of Australians’ expressed views about water recycling, as is a view focused on the ‘risk society’ thesis. The article considers the implications of these findings.},

Therefore, the social effects of innovative solutions to sustainable water management need to be carefully considered. This paper will present findings from research undertaken in California and Florida, USA, and Australia. What is the community response to recycling reclaimed water? Are there ways of involving the public so that the change involved in introducing reclaimed water achieves sustainable outcomes? Results from a series of case studies where indirect potable reuse has been planned will be considered along with the findings from a range of industry surveys, mainly conducted in the USA. In relation to non potable reuse, this paper will cover acceptance of some of the main uses, and householder’s experience of recycling water for residential use. The resulting analysis suggests that the shift from traditional, centrally controlled water supplies to innovative alternatives, requires a corresponding shift in resources to support what is essentially a social transformation in water service delivery and management.},

abstract = {The problem of the optimization of regional wastewater systems may be generally formulated as follows: to define the transport and treatment system in a region or water basin, which assure compliance with given pollution control criteria, with minimum cost. In addition, one may try to satisfy other objectives, such as minimum environmental impact, better effluent reuse or adequate phasing. From the optimization point of view, the two main problems that render the solution difficult are the dimensionality and the concavity of cost functions. The matter has been dealt with by many authors, who have produced varied techniques to try to solve this problem. This paper begins with a brief review of the work of those authors who have produced models specifically designed to study the problem. Then, solution strategies are discussed concerning three major items: definition of the objective function and constraints, optimization method and practical applicability of the models. The paper concludes with the discussion of topics for future research.},

We have investigated WTU and WTP for two crops with two different levels of water treatment. The mean WTP for 1 cm3 of recycled water was 0.15€ for the irrigation of both olive trees and tomato crops, namely 55\% of the fresh water price. The mean WTP for olive oil produced from olive trees irrigated with recycled water was 2.65€, namely 88\% of its current market price.Wehave found that both attitudinal factors, such as environmental awareness and economic factors, such as freshwater prices and incomes, are significant in explaining theWTUand WTP for recycled water and products produced using it, but that important differences exist between farmers and consumers.},

abstract = {The main function of a Wastewater Treatment Plant is to minimize the environmental impact of discharging untreated water into natural water systems. Also a Wastewater Treatment Plant may get a resource from wastewater carrying out a tertiary treatment on the treated wastewater which can be reused in non-potable applications. Water reuse strategies are intended to address the problem of water scarcity without aggravating other environmental problems, thus reflecting the need of their environmental assessment. In this paper we used Life Cycle Assessment to evaluate different disinfection treatments (chlorination plus ultraviolet treatment, ozonation and ozonation plus hydrogen peroxide) and to assess the environmental advantages and drawbacks of urban wastewater reuse in non-potable applications. To do so, we compared the environmental impacts of producing 1m(3) of water for non-potable uses from reclaimed water, potable water and desalinated water sources. The calculation has used current operating data from a Wastewater Treatment Plant located in the Mediterranean area, although the results can be applied to any other plant with similar technology. The ozonation and ozonation plus hydrogen peroxide disinfection treatment technologies have similar environmental profiles. However most of the indicators are about 50\% higher than the ultraviolet disinfection except for the acidification (100\% higher) and photochemical oxidation (less than 5\%). Non-potable uses (both agricultural and urban uses) of reclaimed water have environmental and economical advantages. Reuse of treated wastewater is particularly beneficial when it can replace desalinated water. Consequently, reclaimed water should be promoted for non-potable uses, when there is scarcity of freshwater.},

@article{MilaiCanals2008a,
abstract = {Background, aim and scope Freshwater is a basic resource for humans; however, its link to human health is seldom related to lack of physical access to sufficient freshwater, but rather to poor distribution and access to safe water supplies. On the other hand, freshwater availability for aquatic ecosystems is often reduced due to competition with human uses, potentially leading to impacts on ecosystem quality. This paper summarises how this specific resource use can be dealt with in life cycle analysis (LCA). Main features The main quantifiable impact pathways linking freshwater use to the available supply are identified, leading to definition of the flows requiring quantification in the life cycle inventory (LCI). Results The LCI needs to distinguish between and quantify evaporative and non-evaporative uses of ‘blue’ and ‘green’ water, along with land use changes leading to changes in the availability of freshwater. Suitable indicators are suggested for the two main impact pathways [namely freshwater ecosystem impact (FEI) and freshwater deple- tion (FD)], and operational characterisation factors are provided for a range of countries and situations. For FEI, indicators relating current freshwater use to the available freshwater resources (with and without specific consider- ation of water ecosystem requirements) are suggested. For FD, the parameters required for evaluation of the common- ly used abiotic depletion potentials are explored. Discussion An important value judgement when dealing with water use impacts is the omission or consideration of non-evaporative uses of water as impacting ecosystems.We suggest considering only evaporative uses as a default procedure, although more precautionary approaches (e.g. an ‘Egalitarian’ approach) may also include non-evaporative uses. Variation in seasonal river flows is not captured in the approach suggested for FEI, even though abstractions during droughts may have dramatic consequences for ecosystems; this has been considered beyond the scope of LCA. Conclusions The approach suggested here improves the representation of impacts associated with freshwater use in LCA. The information required by the approach is generally available to LCA practitioners Recommendations and perspectives The widespread use of the approach suggested here will require some development (and consensus) by LCI database devel- opers. Linking the suggested midpoint indicators for FEI to a damage approach will require further analysis of the relationship between FEI indicators and ecosystem health.},

abstract = {Increased water demand and scarce freshwater resources have forced communities to seek nontraditional water sources. These challenges are exacerbated in coastal communities, where population growth rates and densities in the United States are the highest. To understand the current management dilemma between constrained surface and groundwater sources and potential new water sources, Tampa Bay, Florida (TB), and San Diego, California (SD), were studied through 2030 accounting for changes in population, water demand, and electricity grid mix. These locations were chosen on the basis of their similar populations, land areas, economies, and water consumption characters as well as their coastal locations and rising contradictions between water demand and supply. Three scenarios were evaluated for each study area: (1) maximization of traditional supplies; (2) maximization of seawater desalination; and (3) maximization of nonpotable water reclamation. Three types of impacts were assessed: embodied energy, greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, and energy cost. SD was found to have higher embodied energy and energy cost but lower GHG emission than TB in most of its water infrastructure systems because of the differences between the electricity grid mixes and water resources of the two regions. Maximizing water reclamation was found to be better than increasing either traditional supplies or seawater desalination in both regions in terms of the three impact categories. The results further imply the importance of assessing the energy-water nexus when pursuing demand-side control targets or goals as well to ensure that the potentially most economical options are considered.},

Algorithmic and approximation schemes are available to solve MSPPs but these approaches often display complexities prohibitive to their implementa- tion on real-world applications. This paper describes the development of an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) approach to MSPPs on networks with multiple independent criteria. The EA approach is shown to sufficiently explore the underlying network space, generate large candidate path sets, and evolve high quality approximations to the optimal MSPP solution(s). Opportunities for early termination of the EA in time-critical applications are also offered. Among the issues for further work is the integration of the EA as a tool within a GIS for path optimization.},

The corridors are evaluated on two criteria: (i) a quantitative criterion (such as length), and (ii) a qualitative criterion measuring the quality of a corridor with respect to the suitability of crossing its component polygons. To identify the efficient corridors, we designed a very fast algorithm that exploits the qualitative dimension (suitability) of each polygon in order to identify a set of efficient corridors with different suitability levels. The proposed approach and algorithm are validated through the development of a prototype and illustrated on a real-world instance application.

abstract = {A set of indicators that incorporate environmental, societal, and economic sustainability were developed and used to investigate the sustainability of different wastewater treatment technologies, for plant capacities of <5 million gallons per day (MGD) or 18.9 x 10(3) cubic meters (m(3)/day). The technologies evaluated were mechanical (i.e., activated sludge with secondary treatment), lagoon (facultative, anaerobic, and aerobic), and land treatment systems (e.g., slow rate irrigation, rapid infiltration, and overland flow). The economic indicators selected were capital, operation and management, and user costs because they determine the economic affordability of a particular technology to a community. Environmental indicators include energy use, because it indirectly measures resource utilization, and performance of the technology in removing conventional wastewater constituents such as biochemical oxygen demand, ammonia nitrogen, phosphorus, and pathogens. These indicators also determine the reuse potential of the treated wastewater. Societal indicators capture cultural acceptance of the technology through public participation and also measure whether there is improvement in the community from the specific technology through increased job opportunities, better education, or an improved local environment. While selection of a set of indicators is dependent on the geographic and demographic context of a particular community, the overall results of this study show that there are varying degrees of sustainability with each treatment technology.},

abstract = {Due to increasing interest in reusing wastewater in water-deficient regions, we suggest environmental risk assessment (ERA) as a suitable tool to evaluate potential risks from trace pollutants in irrigation water. We propose a simple method for screening environmental risks associated with reusing wastewater, which can predict potential risks in terrestrial ecosystems based on the concentration of pollutants in the effluent to be reused. This method was tested in a case study including 27 priority and emerging pollutants found in effluents from two Spanish wastewater-treatment plants (WWTPs). The results showed that secondary effluents from these Spanish WWTPs were likely to cause adverse effects, due particularly to the presence of some pharmaceuticals and heavy metals.},

abstract = {Life Cycle Assessment has been used to compare different scenarios involving wastewater reuse, with special focus on toxicity-related impact categories. The study is based on bench-scale experiments applying ozone and ozone in combination with hydrogen peroxide to a wastewater effluent from a Spanish sewage treatment plant. Two alternative characterisation models have been used to account for toxicity of chemical substances, namely USES-LCA and EDIP97. Four alternative scenarios have been assessed: wastewater discharge plus desalination supply, wastewater reuse without tertiary treatment, wastewater reuse after applying a tertiary treatment consisting on ozonation, and wastewater reuse after applying ozonation in combination with hydrogen peroxide. The results highlight the importance of including wastewater pollutants in LCA of wastewater systems assessing toxicity, since the contribution of wastewater pollutants to the overall toxicity scores in this case study can be above 90\%. Key pollutants here are not only heavy metals and other priority pollutants, but also non-regulated pollutants such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products. Wastewater reuse after applying any of the tertiary treatments considered appears as the best choice from an ecotoxicity perspective. As for human toxicity, differences between scenarios are smaller, and taking into account the experimental and modelling uncertainty, the benefits of tertiary treatment are not so clear. From a global warming potential perspective, tertiary treatments involve a potential 85\% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions when compared with desalination.},

The environmental assessment of these water treatment technologies has been realized by means of the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) technique, in order to establish with a broad perspective and in a rigorous and objective way the technology that provokes the lowest environmental load. The software SimaPro 5.1, developed by Dutch PRe´ Consultants, has been used as the LCA analysis tool, and three different evaluation methods—CML 2 baseline 2000, Eco-Points 97 and Eco-Indicator 99—have been applied. The results show that tertiary treatment does not increase significantly the environmental loads but provide new uses for that purified water, thus justifying the intensive use of water reuse techniques in water scarce areas.},

A GIS-based multi-criteria analysis was performed, combining ten thematic maps and economic, environmental and technical criteria, in order to produce a suitability map for the location of sites for reclaimed water infiltration. The areas chosen for aquifer recharge with infiltration basins are mainly composed of anthrosol with more than 1m deep and fine sand texture, which allows an average infiltration velocity of up to 1md−1. These characteristics will pro- vide a final polishing treatment of the reclaimed water after infiltration (soil aquifer treatment (SAT)), suitable for the removal of the residual load (trace organics, nutrients, heavy metals and pathogens). The risk of groundwater contamination is low since the water table in the anthrosol areas ranges from 10mto 50m. On the other hand, these depths allow a guaranteed unsaturated area suitable for SAT. An area of 13,944ha was selected for study, but only 1607ha are suitable for reclaimed water infiltration. Approximately 1280m2 were considered enough to set up 4 infiltration basins to work in flooding and drying cycles. ©},

abstract = {Providing our society with goods and services contributes to a wide range of environmental impacts. Waste generation, emissions and the consumption of resources occur at many stages in a product's life cycle-from raw material extraction, energy acquisition, production and manufacturing, use, reuse, recycling, through to ultimate disposal. These all contribute to impacts such as climate change, stratospheric ozone depletion, photooxidant formation (smog), eutrophication, acidification, toxicological stress on human health and ecosystems, the depletion of resources and noise-among others. The need exists to address these product-related contributions more holistically and in an integrated manner, providing complimentary insights to those of regulatory/process-oriented methodologies. A previous article (Part 1, Rebitzer et al., 2004) outlined how to define and model a product's life cycle in current practice, as well as the methods and tools that are available for compiling the associated waste, emissions and resource consumption data into a life cycle inventory. This article highlights how practitioners and researchers from many domains have come together to provide indicators for the different impacts attributable to products in the life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) phase of life cycle assessment (LCA).},

This method considers damages to three areas of protection: human health, ecosystem quality, and resources. The method can be used within most existing life-cycle impact assessment (LCIA) methods. The relative importance of water consumption was analyzed by integrating the method into the Eco-indicator-99 LCIA method. The relative impact of water consumption in LCIA was analyzed with a case study on worldwide cotton production. The importance of regionalized characterization factors for water use was also examined in the case study. In arid regions, water consumption may dominate the aggregated life-cycle impacts of cotton-textile production. Therefore, the consideration of water consumption is crucial in life-cycle assessment (LCA) studies that include water-intensive products, such as agricultural goods. A regionalized assessment is necessary, since the impacts of water use vary greatly as a function of location. The presented method is useful for environmental decision-support in the production of water-intensive products as well as for environmentally responsible value-chain management.},

Three processes within the facility use phase of the life cycle were considered: Chemical production, transportation of materials, and water treatment plant operation. The impacts of chemical manufacturing were estimated using the economic input-output life-cycle assessment model, while the inventories for transportation and operational environmental effects were based on data from the GHGenius model and regionally averaged data. Operational burdens, 60\% of which are attributed to on-site pumping, accounted for 94\% of total energy use and 90\% of GHG emissions. By contrast, transportation-related energy use and emissions were deemed insignificant. The normalized energy use of the studied WTS was found to be between 2.3 and 2.5 MJ/m3 of water treated. Water conservation practices are recommended as abatement strategies for the energy use and GHG emissions associated with water treatment. The limitations and uncertainties introduced by selected model parameters and through combining various estimation methodologies are discussed, as is the model’s relevance.},

abstract = {Sustainable development requires methods and tools to measure and compare the environmental impacts of human activities for the provision of goods and services (both of which are summarized under the term "products"). Environmental impacts include those from emissions into the environment and through the consumption of resources, as well as other interventions (e.g., land use) associated with providing products that occur when extracting resources, producing materials, manufacturing the products, during consumption/use, and at the products' end-of-life (collection/sorting, reuse, recycling, waste disposal). These emissions and consumptions contribute to a wide range of impacts, such as climate change, stratospheric ozone depletion, tropospheric ozone (smog) creation, eutrophication, acidification, toxicological stress on human health and ecosystems, the depletion of resources, water use, land use, and noise-among others. A clear need, therefore, exists to be proactive and to provide complimentary insights, apart from current regulatory practices, to help reduce such impacts. Practitioners and researchers from many domains come together in life cycle assessment (LCA) to calculate indicators of the aforementioned potential environmental impacts that are linked to products-supporting the identification of opportunities for pollution prevention and reductions in resource consumption while taking the entire product life cycle into consideration. This paper, part 1 in a series of two, introduces the LCA framework and procedure, outlines how to define and model a product's life cycle, and provides an overview of available methods and tools for tabulating and compiling associated emissions and resource consumption data in a life cycle inventory (LCI). It also discusses the application of LCA in industry and policy making. The second paper, by Pennington et al. (Environ. Int. 2003, in press), highlights the key features, summarises available approaches, and outlines the key challenges of assessing the aforementioned inventory data in terms of contributions to environmental impacts (life cycle impact assessment, LCIA).},

abstract = {Facing the increase of environmental concern in the water treatment field, stakeholders need reliable decision support tools to assess envi- ronmental performances of urban and industrial wastewater systems. To discuss how life cycle assessment (LCA) can be applied to wastewater treatment projects, such an assessment has been performed through a case study on a full-scale plant. Methodological issues that had to be dealt with are briefly exposed. Five life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) methods have been used: CML 2000, Eco Indicator 99, EDIP 96, EPS and Ecopoints 97. Consistent assessment between these methods has been obtained for greenhouse effect, resources depletion and acidification. Eu- trophication is correctly estimated if one looks at the potential impact of a treatment scenario but not at the characterization of the eutrophication state of a specific receiving stream.Work is needed concerning human toxicity as large discrepancies are noticed between the impact assessment methods.},

abstract = {Water and energy are the key resources required for both economic and population growth, and yet both are increasingly scarce. The distribution of water takes large amounts of energy, while the production of energy requires large amounts of water in processes such as thermal plant cooling systems or rawmaterials extraction. This study analyzes thewater needs for energy production in Spain according to the energy source sector (electricity, transportation or domestic) and process type (extraction and refining of raw materials or thermal plant use). Current and future water needs are quantified according to energy demand and technology mix evolution. Hypothetical scenarios that simulate the risks of promoting specific energy policies are also analyzed. Results show that the combination of energy resources used in Spain is projected to be more than 25\% more water consumptive in 2030 than in 2005 under ceteris paribus conditions. Renewable energies are mixed in terms of their consequences on the water supply; wind power can reduce water withdrawal, while the biofuels production is a water-intensive process.},

This study includes a comprehensive literature review that summarizes TWM principles and real world applications in the United States and abroad. The literature review was organized into different regions of the country in order to reflect geographic water management drivers and challenges. An evaluation protocol for analyzing TWM is presented, along with a detailed discussion of modeling techniques. A desk top analysis was conducted to demonstrate how TWM alternatives would perform against traditional approaches to water management using a sy stems model. The model simulates supply r eliability, total lifecycle costs, water wastewater capacity, quality of receiving waters, and a number of environmental indicators. The Water Evaluation and P lanning (WEAP) software, developed by the Stockholm E nvironment Institute, was used as the modeling platform. The City of Los Angeles was used as t he case study f or desktop analysis, using r eal data within a real planning context. The City was divided into four demand areas, each with its own connections to surface water, groundwater, and imported water supply sources, i.e., w ater f rom outside City limits, as well as connections to wastewater treatment plants and receiving waters. TWM strategies that were evaluated included increased water conservation, expanded water recycling and reuse, graywater, stormwater recharge, and rainwater harvesting. The WEAP model simulated how integrated water supply, stormwater and water quality management can provide increased opportunities for achieving urban system goals that would not exist in single-purpose, traditional planning.},

abstract = {Indirect potable reuse schemes are an important consideration in the sustainable management of scarce water resources. However, communities still hold real concerns about the potential health risks of micropullutants in recycled water entering their potable water supply. Microfiltration or ultrafiltration followed by reverse osmosis is currently the standard treatment technology for potable use of recycled water. Nevertheless, membranes are not 100\% efficient in the removal of trace organic contaminants and the potential health risks of these micropullutants need to be assessed. The aim of this paper is to present a three-tiered approach for the preliminary assessment of micropullutants in recycled water. A risk quotient is calculated by comparing measured concentrations against benchmark values. Tier 1 corresponds to regulated chemicals; the maximum contaminant level in drinking water is used as benchmark value. Tier 2 corresponds to unregulated chemicals with toxicity information; slope factors or risk specific doses are used to calculate benchmark values. Tier 3 corresponds to unregulated chemicals without toxicity information. The "Threshold of Toxicological Concern" concept is used to calculate benchmark values. The characterization of chemicals of concern following reverse osmosis in a water reclamation plant and the application of the three-tiered approach for the evaluation of the potential health risks is presented.},

Consequently, urban centers are looking to alternative sources of water supply that can supplement variable rainfall and meet the demands of population growth. A diversified portfolio of water sources is required to ensure public health, as well as social, economical and environmental sustainability. One of the options considered is the augmentation of drinking water supplies with advanced treated recycled water. This paper aims to provide a state of the art review of water recycling for drinking purposes with emphasis on membrane treatment processes. An overview of significant indirect potable reuse projects is presented followed by a description of the epidemiological and toxicological studies evaluating any potential human health impacts. Finally, a summary of key operational measures to protect human health and the areas that require further research are discussed.},

Using the GIS and a geographically referenced database, a decision-aid tool for multicriteria evaluation of route alignments is de- veloped. Possible alignments are evaluated based on community disruption and environmental, geotechnical, and geometric design criteria. The developed decision-aid tool integrates slope stability and roadway design packages and specifically written codes with GIS packages ARC/INFO and ArcView, the latter acting as the system engine and interface. A case study is presented that applies the developed platform to the testing of potential alignments for a proposed 12 km highway to the south of the city of Beirut, Lebanon. Results of the case study demonstrated the advantages of the decision-aid tool and highlighted its potential in providing a quick, multicriteria screening evaluation of possible route alignments.},

The framework focuses on key interactions and feedback mechanisms between infrastructure and surrounding environmental, economic, and social systems. One way of understanding and quantifying these interacting effects is through the use of sustainability criteria and indicators.

abstract = {Direct potable reuse (DPR), in which purified municipal wastewater is introduced into a water treatment plant intake or directly into the water distribution system, is becoming an increasingly attractive alternative to developing new water sources (Tchobanoglous et al., 2011). The rationale for DPR is based on the technical ability to reliably produce purified water that meets all drinking water standards and the need to secure dependable water supplies in areas that have, or are expected to have, limited and/or highly variable sources. To meet the purification level required, wastewater treated by conventional means undergoes additional treatment steps to remove residual suspended and dissolved matter, including trace organics. Questions of public acceptance are answered, in part, by the successful incorporation of DPR in the small resort town of Cloudcroft, New Mexico; by the Colorado River Water District serving a population of 250,000 in Big Spring, Stanton, Midland, and Odessa, Texas; and by the results of a recent public acceptance survey (Macpherson and Snyder, in press).},

abstract = {Long term water availability is of increasing concern worldwide. In the United States alone, water demand has tripled since the 1950’s, while efficiency measures have only amounted to a savings of roughly one percent. The rapid increase in worldwide brackish and ocean water desalination capacity, in addition to the global proliferation of long haul fresh water transfers is indicative of the lengths to which populations will go to secure their water supplies. Such projects have high capital and operational costs. For example, desalination requires at least ten times more energy to deliver each gallon of fresh water than nearby fresh surface and groundwater sources require. Unfortunately, local fresh water sources can be of limited availability. Over-use of local fresh water supplies can drive ecosystems and ecosystem services to collapse, while over-extraction of groundwater can lead to irreversible salinization. We present a global freshwater allocation model that is optimized for primary energy efficiency. Freshwater sources and potential sources as well as local electricity fuel mixes and other geographic data are used to approximate the amount of energy needed to durably supply water to various locations, such that long term fresh water availability is not put at risk. Results are presented at a 0.1 degree spatial resolution. Initial results indicate that many heavily populated urban areas are overusing local water supplies and underinvesting in the infrastructure needed to avoid long term water availability risk. Furthermore, antagonistic moral and economic signals are creating contradictory signals to water consumers—to the detriment of real water sustainability. The results of this analysis will be used elsewhere to support a partial equilibrium model that estimates the most economically efficient price for residential water for multiple cities worldwide.},

abstract = {The traditional concept of Aquifer Storage and Recovery (ASR) has been emphasized and extensively applied for water resources conservation in arid and semi-arid regions using groundwater systems as introduced in Pyne's book titled Groundwater Recharge and Wells. This paper extends the \{ASR\} concept to an integrated level in which either treated or untreated surface water or reclaimed wastewater is stored in a suitable aquifer through a system of spreading basins, infiltration galleries and recharge wells; and part or all of the stored water is recovered through production wells, dual function recharge wells, or by streams receiving increased discharge from the surrounding recharged aquifer as needed. In this paper, the author uses the El Paso Water Utilities (EPWU) \{ASR\} system for injection of reclaimed wastewater into the Hueco Bolson aquifer as an example to address challenges and resolutions faced during the design and operation of an \{ASR\} system under a new \{ASR\} system definition. This new \{ASR\} system concept consists of four subsystems: source water, storage space-aquifer, recharge facilities and recovery facilities. Even though facing challenges, this system has successfully recharged approximately 74.7 million cubic meters (19.7 billion gallons) of reclaimed wastewater into the Hueco Bolson aquifer through 10 recharge wells in the last 18 years. This \{ASR\} system has served dual purposes: reuse of reclaimed wastewater to preserve native groundwater, and restoration of groundwater by artificial recharge of reclaimed wastewater into the Hueco Bolson aquifer.},

abstract = {The water-energy nexus is of growing interest for researchers and policy makers because the two critical resources are interdependent. Their provision and consumption contribute to climate change through the release of greenhouse gases (GHGs). This research considers the potential for conserving both energy and water resources by measuring the life-cycle economic efficiency of greenhouse gas reductions through the water loss control technologies of pressure management and leak management. These costs are compared to other GHG abatement technologies: lighting, building insulation, electricity generation, and passenger transportation. Each cost is calculated using a bottom-up approach where regional and temporal variations for three different California water utilities are applied to all alternatives. The costs and abatement potential for each technology are displayed on an environmental abatement cost curve. The results reveal that water loss control can reduce GHGs at lower cost than other technologies and well below California's expected carbon trading price floor. One utility with an energy-intensive water supply could abate 135,000 Mg of GHGs between 2014 and 2035 and save-rather than spend-more than \$130/Mg using the water loss control strategies evaluated. Water loss control technologies therefore should be considered in GHG abatement portfolios for utilities and policy makers.},

Results from a case study treatment plant which produces electricity using methane offgas are discussed. The case study system supplements influent with ‘high-strength organic waste’ to augment electricity production. The system balance is 55 kg of greenhouse gases per million liters of wastewater. Sensitivity analysis confirms that reusing biogas from anaerobic digestion for electricity reduces life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions by nine times. When biogas is captured and reused for electricity, material production (e.g., chemicals and pipes) and the corresponding supply chains, rather than energy production, are responsible for most of the environmental effects. When biogas is flared, the material and energy production contributions are similar.},

abstract = {Life-cycle air emission effects of supplying water are explored using a hybrid life-cycle assessment. For the typically sized U.S. utility analyzed, recycled water is preferable to desalination and comparable to importation. Seawater desalination has an energy and air emission footprint that is 1.5-2.4 times larger than that of imported water. However, some desalination modes fare better; brackish groundwater is 53-66\% as environmentally intensive as seawater desalination. The annual water needs (326 m3) of a typical Californian that is met with imported water requires 5.8 GJ of energy and creates 360 kg of CO2 equivalent emissions. With seawater desalination, energy use would increase to 14 GJ and 800 kg ofCO2 equivalent emissions. Meeting the water demand of California with desalination would consume 52\% of the state’s electricity. Supply options were reassessed using alternative electricity mixes, including the average mix of the United States and several renewable sources. Desalination using solar thermal energy has lower greenhouse gas emissions than that of imported and recycled water (using California’s electricity mix), but using the U.S. mix increases the environmental footprint by 1.5 times. A comparison with a more energy-intensive international scenario shows that CO2 equivalent emissions for desalination in Dubai are 1.6 times larger than in California. The methods, decision support tool (WEST), and results of this study should persuade decision makers to make informed water policy choices by including energy consumption and material use effects in the decision-making process.},

abstract = {The exploration of life-cycle energy use and environmental effects from U.S. water infrastructure has been limited in spite of the strong connection between energy and water use. This research presents a methodology for quantifying the life-cycle energy consumption and associated air emissions from water supply, treatment, and distribution. A decision-support tool, the Water-Energy Sustainability Tool (WEST), has been developed to aid such analysis. WEST calculates the environmental effects of material production, including the supply chain, material delivery and transportation, construction and maintenance equipment use, energy production, and sludge disposal. Deter- ministic and probabilistic results for a California case study utility are provided to show the tool’s capabilities. Results indicate that producing a million liters of water consumes 5.4 GJ and produces 390 kg of CO2-equivalent greenhouse gases. Energy production is the most significant activity (50\%), but material production, especially for treatment chemicals, is also important (37\%). This case study is contrasted with two previously published case study utilities, and the reasons for the range of results are analyzed. The results demonstrate that estimating water supply’s energy needs and emissions without a life-cycle lens can underestimate the total effects significantly.},

In addition to the conventional impact categories used in LCA, a new soil salinisation potential is included. The environmental impact contribution from the construction phase of each technology is estimated using the Missing Inventory Estimation Tool (MIET) approach which relies on the input–output analysis technique.

abstract = {Life Cycle Assessment was applied to municipal planning in a study of waste water systems in Bergsj6n, a G6teborg suburb, and Hamburgsund, a coastal village. Existing waste water treat- ment consists of mechanical, biological and chemical treatment. The heat in the waste water from Bergsjon is recovered for the district heating system. One alternative studied encompassed pretreatment, anaerobic digestion or drying of the solid frac- tion and treatment of the liquid fraction in sand filter beds. In another alternative, urine, faeces and grey water would sepa- rately be conducted out of the buildings. The urine would be used as fertilizer, whereas faeces would be digested or dried, before used in agriculture. The grey water would be treated in filter beds. Changes in the waste water system would affect surrounding technical systems (drinking water production, dis- trict heating and fertilizer production). This was approached through system enlargement. For Hamburgsund, both alter- natives showed lower environmental impact than the existing system, and the urine separation system the lowest. Bergsj6n results were more difficult to interpret. Energy consumption was lowest for the existing system, whereas air emissions were lower for the alternatives. Water emissions increased for some parameters and decreased for others. Phosphorous recovery was high for all three alternatives, whereas there was virtually no nitrogen recovery until urine separation was introduced.},

Even though reclaimed water reuse is currently implemented in many European countries, mainly for irrigation, its potential has not yet been exploited in many areas. In fact, a decisive factor to achieve a higher percentage of water reuse is the establishment of effective incentives, which in many instances will be of either an economic or a regulatory nature. The limiting factor for water reuse can in many circumstances be the quality of the water available linked to the treatment processes (technology) and potential hazards for secondary users. In any case, its economic viability needs a careful cost-benefit analysis for the various parties involved to be carried out. However, some water reuse implementation projects have failed because some other key factors, such as social awareness or associated ecological effects, were not accounted for. Thus, the consideration of regulatory, economic, technological, social and environmental factors seems essential to successfully accomplish a reclaimed water reuse project. Feasibility studies can contribute to obtain the success in the implementation of a water reuse project. Within AQUAREC a feasibility study methodology for the performance of water reuse projects has been developed, considering the above mentioned key factors and providing the tools for their analysis. These guidelines aim at assisting the different stakeholders (administration, engineering companies, water management bodies, etc.) involved in the implementation of a water reuse programme in a specific area. AQUAREC Handbook on Feasibility Studies for Water Reuse Systems, publicly available, deals with all information},

abstract = {About 20\% of the total surface water in Europe is strongly threatened due to pollution problems, and 60\% of European cities over-exploit their groundwater resources. The European Framework Water Directive established that by the year 2015 “a good ecological state” of all European water resources and a sustainable use of water must be achieved. Wastewater reuse presents a promising solution to the growing pressure on Europe’s water resources. However, wastewater reuse implementation in Europe faces obstacles that include insufficient public acceptance; technical, economic and hygienic risks; and lack of regulations. On the other hand, a very important aspect to implement a water reuse project is the feasibility study that was previously developed. Some of the work carried out in a European project called Integrated Concepts for Reuse of Upgraded Wastewater is described herein. One of the most important tasks of this project is to prepare guidelines on feasibility studies for water reuse systems. The defined structure to carry out feasibility studies and some guidelines to obtain an ecological, social and economical assessment is described.},

abstract = {In the field of Ecological Economics, the need of using physical indicators to analyse economic processes, at the same time they serve as tools in decision making, has been lately highlighted. Virtual Water (VW) and Water Footprint (WF) are two useful indicators in achieving this objective, the first one from the perspective of production, the second one from that of consumption. This difference between them is interesting inasmuch as it allows to identify the subjects who are responsible for water consumption, whether producers or consumers, and proves both indicators’ potential when designing water management policies. In this work, we consider a hypothesis according to which there is a clear difference between the two concepts—Virtual Water and Water Footprint—and this difference, although evident in their respective conceptualizations, is not reflected in their estimations and applications. This is true to the point that the two concepts are often used as synonyms, thus wasting the enormous potential associated to their difference. Starting from this hypothesis, our objective is, first of all, to highlight this evident but ignored difference betweenVWandWF through a deep and thorough literature review of the conceptual definitions and contributions, the methodologies developed and the applications made regarding the two concepts. Second, we intend to make a conceptual and methodological proposition aimed at underlining the differences alreadymentioned and to identify responsibilities in water consumption. We do it by broadening the context of analysis and by integrating the production–consumption binomial and water–energy nexus.},

abstract = {A process optimization method has been developed for the design of reverse osmosis (RO) processes. RO process configurations are systematically generated using a flexible superstructure and evaluated by economical (investment and operating costs), technical (energy requirement, water recovery rate) and environmental performance indicators (Life Cycle Assessment). The simultaneous optimization of the RO process layout and operating conditions constitutes a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem, which is solved using a multi-objective optimization (MOO) approach. The MOO identifies the best technological alternatives for the set of selected objectives. In a given context, it allows to define a set of optimal solutions representing the trade-off between conflicting objectives such as economical costs and environmental impacts. As a case study, the methodology is applied on a brackish water reverse osmosis (BWRO) desalination project, for which the optimal design is characterized depending on the economical conditions.},

abstract = {This paper describes the implementation of life cycle assessment to investigate the environmental impact of 20 technologies suitable for treating extensive volumes of water produced during the oil and gas extraction processes. Data on the physical and operational attributes of technologies under consideration were assembled and their life cycle environmental impacts estimated over 15 year time period. The results were then incorporated in a decision support system which allows identification and prioritisation of potential technology combinations capable of producing water for nine designated industrial and agricultural end uses. In total, more than 618 technology combinations were investigated for their environmental impacts. The identification and prioritisation of technologies were done on the basis of their environmental and technical performance. This analysis showed that dissolved air flotation, absorbents, dual media filtration and reverse osmosis technologies offer relatively low environmental impact parts of systems for cleaning such process waters. Furthermore, the environmental assessment combined within the decision support system has revealed potentially valuable indirect downstream "benefits" from effects such as evaporative losses from wetlands in terms of the overall environmental impact of a treatment system.},

To effectively use models, the engineer must be able to link knowledge of basic hydraulic theory and the mechanics of the program with that of the operation of real-world systems. The purpose of this book is to provide a practical resource for engineers and modelers that goes well beyond being a how-to guide for typing data into a computer program. It contains straightforward answers to common questions related both to modeling and to distribution systems in general. The scope of this text includes such topics as: - Definitions and industry standards - Model assembly and verification - Effective use of models as decision-support tools - Recent innovations in modeling The method in which these issues are approached is designed to be readily accessible for immediate application by practicing engineers, while sufficiently comprehensive for student use. Continuing Education and Problem Sets Included in this text are approximately 100 hydraulics and modeling problems to give students and professionals the opportunity to apply the material covered in each chapter. The accompanying CD-ROM in the back of the book contains an academic version of Haestad Methods’ WaterCAD, which can be used to solve many of the problems, as well as data files with much of the given information in the problems pre-entered.},

abstract = {A comprehensive environmental monitoring program based on a sound statistical design is necessary to provide estimates of the status of, and changes or trends in, the condition of ecological resources. A sampling design based upon a systematic grid can adequately assess the condition of many types of resources and retain flexibility for addressing new issues as they arise. The randomization of this grid requires that it be regular and retain equal-area cells when projected on the surface of the earth. After review of existing approaches to constructing regular subdivisions of the earth's surface, we propose the development of the sampling grid on the Lambert azimuthal equal\~{}areamap projection of the earth's surface to the face of a truncated icosahedron fit to the globe. This geometric model has less deviation in area when subdivided as a spherical tessellation than any of the spherical Platonic solids, and less distortion in shape over the extent of a face when used for a projection surface by the Lambert azimuthal projection. A hexagon face of the truncated icosahedron covers the entire conterminous United States, and can be decomposed into a triangular grid at an appropriate density for sampling. The geometry of the triangular grid provides for varying the density, and points on the grid can be addressed in several ways.},

abstract = {The geospatial sciences face grand information technology (IT) challenges in the twenty-first century: data intensity, computing intensity, concurrent access intensity and spatiotemporal intensity. These challenges require the readiness of a computing infrastructure that can: (1) better support discovery, access and utilization of data and data processing so as to relieve scientists and engineers of IT tasks and focus on scientific discoveries; (2) provide real-time IT resources to enable real-time applications, such as emergency response; (3) deal with access spikes; and (4) provide more reliable and scalable service for massive numbers of concurrent users to advance public knowledge. The emergence of cloud computing provides a potential solution with an elastic, on-demand computing platform to integrate observation systems, parameter extracting algorithms, phenomena simulations, analytical visualization and decision support, and to provide social impact and user feedback the essential elements of the geospatial sciences. We discuss the utilization of cloud computing to support the intensities of geospatial sciences by reporting from our investigations on how cloud computing could enable the geospatial sciences and how spatiotemporal principles, the kernel of the geospatial sciences, could be utilized to ensure the benefits of cloud computing. Four research examples are presented to analyze how to: (1) search, access and utilize geospatial data; (2) configure computing infrastructure to enable the computability of intensive simulation models; (3) disseminate and utilize research results for massive numbers of concurrent users; and (4) adopt spatiotemporal principles to support spatiotemporal intensive applications.

In the U.S., energy production and power generation systems are major users of freshwater resources besides agriculture. The major goal of this report is to show dependency of energy production and power generation systems on water availability.},

@article{Zhu1989,
abstract = {This paper is divided into two parts. In the first part of the paper, the plant location model is adapted for the special case of siting wastewater treatment facilities when the wastewater sources and treatment facilities are arranged in a chain or linear configuration. In this problem, flows or shipments may be merged in common pipes that provide economies of scale in transport. In order to apply the plant location model, an appropriate definition of the additional cost incurred when a waste source joins a regional facility is required. In addition, sequential priority constraints are developed in the siting model in order to make possible proper accounting of transport costs. The new siting model can be conveniently solved by linear programming. In the second part of the paper, a dual of the plant location model is explored as a cost allocation method for the fixed charge facility siting problem. The constraint sets of the dual model can be shown to imply the core conditions of the related cost game; hence, a set of the dual variables from the dual problem can be regarded as rational cost allocations. The analysis places both facility siting and cost allocation in a common framework.},
